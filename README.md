# Notes
Any custom models generated start from ID 63 downwards, ensuring minimal conflict with plugins such as Na2's MCGalaxy-CustomModels

# Usage
host models/sign.png on a website such as garbage.loan

Type /model bot botname sign_text here etc\nanother line\nanother line\nfinal line

signwall_text also works, and other custom sign models with part named "board" can be placed in the models folder
 
to place a sign, make sure to then manually set the bot / player's skin to the hosted sign.png to have it textured
