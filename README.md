# Notes
Any custom models generated start from ID 63 downwards, ensuring minimal conflict with plugins such as Na2's MCGalaxy-CustomModels

# Usage
Copy the models folder into the plugins folder

If you don't already have `Newtonsoft.Json.dll` from [NA2 Custom Models](https://github.com/NotAwesome2/MCGalaxy-CustomModels), download it and paste it into the same directory as MCGalaxy.exe

`/sign sign_model text here etc`

eg

`/sign sign This is a standing sign with a stick`

`/sign signwall This is a sign that would go on the center of a wall without a stick`

Also updates the model of any entity with the model of `validsignmodel_text here` with a sign, like `sign_Hello there` or `signwall_Hello there`
