# Notes
Any custom models generated start from ID 63 downwards, ensuring minimal conflict with plugins such as Na2's MCGalaxy-CustomModels

Only currently supports lower case letters part of the standard alphabet, any upper case letters or symbols/numbers will display incorrect characters

# Usage
`/sign sign_model text here etc`

eg

`/sign sign This is a standing sign with a stick`

`/sign signwall This is a sign that would go on the center of a wall without a stick`

Also updates the model of any entity with the model of `validsignmodel_text here` with a sign, like `sign_Hello there` or `signwall_Hello there`
